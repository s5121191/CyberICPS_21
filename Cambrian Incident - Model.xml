<vulnerability_type name="Configuration" >
  <description>A vulnerability resulting from an error in the configuration and administration of a system or component.</description>
</vulnerability_type>
<vulnerability_type name="Design" >
  <description>A vulnerability inherent in the design or specification of hardware or software whereby even a perfect implementation will result in a vulnerability.</description>
</vulnerability_type>
<vulnerability_type name="Implementation" >
  <description>A vulnerability resulting from an error made in implementing software or hardware of a satisfactory design.</description>
</vulnerability_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/DoS and DDoS" >
  <description>A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack involves a malicious attempt to disrupt the operation of a computer system or network that is connected to the Internet.  A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a more dangerous evolution of a DoS attack because it utilises a network of compromised zombie computers to mount the attack, so there is no identifiable single source.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/Hacking" >
  <description>Hackers want to get into your computer system and use them for their own purposes.  There are many hacking tools available on the internet as well as online communities actively discussing hacking techniques enabling even unskilled hackers to break into unprotected systems.  Hackers have a range of motives; from showing off their technical prowess, to theft of money, credentials or information, to cause damage.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/Keystoke logging" >
  <description>Keystroke loggers work by recording the sequence of key-strokes that a user types in.  The more sophisticated versions use filtering mechanisms to only record highly prized information such as email addresses, passwords and credit card number sequences.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/Malware" >
  <description>Malware is any program or file that is harmful to a computer, the term covers viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware.  Malware is becoming increasingly sophisticated and can be used to compromise computers to install DOS zombie programs or other malicious programs.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/Phishing and Spoofing" >
  <description>Phishing describes a social engineering process designed to trick an organisation's customers into imparting confidential information such as passwords, personal data or banking and financial details.  Most commonly these are criminal attacks but the same techniques could be used by others to get sensitive information.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Insider/Manipulation" >
  <description>Sometimes deliberate attempts are made to acquire information or access by manipulating staff by using a range of influencing techniques.  This is sometimes described as social engineering, creating situations in which someone will willingly provide access to information, sites or systems to someone unauthorised to receive it.  Customer facing personnel who have been trained to be helpful and informative can be particularly vulnerable to such attacks.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Insider/Sabotage" >
  <description>Saborage is often committed by a former employee seeking revenge on their employer because of a personal grudge caused by a negative work related event such as dismissal.  Although it is sometimes planned well in advance, it can also be the result of an opportunistic moment.</description>

<project_settings name="Cambrian Incident Report - Case Study" >
  <background>On the morning of 20 October 2017, four trains travelled over the Cambrian Coast railway in the UK while temporary speed restriction (TSR) data was not being sent to the trains by the ERTMS/ETCS Level 2 signalling system. The TSR data was not uploaded during an automated signalling computer restart the previous evening, but a display screen used by the signaller to verify the uploading of TSRs incorrectly showed the restrictions as being loaded for transmission to trains. The fault was only recognised when a train driver realised he had passed over a level crossing at excessive speed because a TSR that applied on the approach to the crossing was not displayed on his driver machine interface (DMI) and he reported this to the control centre.

No accident resulted, but this was clearly a significant wrong side failure of the first ERTMS/ETCS application in the UK and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) decided to launch a full investigation. It turned out to be one of the most complex investigations undertaken by RAIB since its inception and it was over two years before the full report was published on 19 December 2019.

The RAIB investigation report gave following recommendations:
Where a safety process requires an operator to check information on a computer screen, 'Liveness' of the information displayed is crucial.
The safety case for an 'Intermediate SIL' system must take account of failure modes of the software architecture.
Good communication between safety engineers and software developers is essential.
'Fit and Forget' is never ALARP for a software-based system.

<persona name="Ray" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="" >
  <activities>Ray as train driver begins his job, by booking on and getting updated information on his laptop. This is based on documentation received about booking depot and preparing train for service. Also, before operating train Ray is going to perform an on-board European Train Control System (ETCS) self-test function for finding faults and failures. He is going to produce a failure report and proceed only if the status of train for service is Safe and Fit.
Ray is managing his operations by the help of the Driver Machine Interface (DMI) available in his driving cab. The DMI is based on European Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS). Through DMI, Ray enters data into an on-board system. As a result, Ray receives information about his train route and allowed train speed. In order to ensure safe movement of trains, Ray takes action based on movement authority sent to him by signaller. 
There are some activities which Ray performs to ensure efficient movement of trains, like switching of isolation mode. It is Rays job to identify the End of Authority for trains. Ray's driving cab has ERTMS reset, and sometimes under special circumstances he has the authority to reset. It is also Rays job to keep on observing signals for danger and stop the train immediately to avoid any catastrophic accidents. 
</activities>
  <attitudes>Ray enters the driving cab, connected to ERTMS on-board equipment and opens the desk. The driving cab has fleet plan, which identifies the train for service by train running number. Also, the cargo manifest and other documentation are available. A major part of his job is to get signal directives by communicating with train signaller. The train signaller is responsible for advising Ray about ERTMS mode required, maximum speed allowed, permission to precede movement etc.  
Ray starts driving upon getting the driver advisory information like driver ID, train running number etc, on his screen. During operation, he notices that the train is able to approach a level crossing three times its actual speed limit. Ray is able to timely recognize this fault. Ray can pass messages through ERTMS on-board equipment to ERTMS trackside equipment, for his routine job. Therefore, after notifying to signaller, Ray reverts to manual routing, in order to not disturb the normal service of train.
Ray is able to take operational control decisions of his vehicle by the help of information displayed on his ERTMS DMI. The ERTMS DMI displays him speed limit, train positions etc. He also gets alerts in case of any errors or warnings, and even change in supervision is communicated to him by signaller through ERTMS DMI. Ray has no room for making any mistakes while interpreting this information even when notified about stop markers.
In case of any failure, Ray is notified by signaller and he has to take appropriate actions accordingly. Rays job will be compromised, if due to IT failure or momentary loss of signal detection he is unable to receive data packets which contain information on operations of trains transmitted via GSM-R technology.
</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Ray has a huge responsibility for controlling movement of trains which carries passengers and other staff members; hence he needs to remain vigilant during duty hours. During early hours of his duty, he noticed train was travelling at 80km per hour rather than 30km per hour enroute Barmouth and Llanaber. Ray observed and reported this fault from information displayed on DMI. Ray is making all decisions by interacting with ERTMS DMI, thus the reliability and availability of ERTMS DMI is directly affecting his tasks efficiency.
His active state of mind is must for making accurate decisions during job. He is responsible for switching in between different ERTMS levels for train movement control. Sometimes during driving Ray even receives text messages as a part of ERTMS operational control job. These might be a cause of distraction and lead to safety hazards.

<persona name="Neil" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="" >
  <activities>Neil is performing the job of railway signaller. Neil working from his signaller's workstation is responsible for monitoring and controlling train movements. Neil begins his routine tasks by granting possession and isolation, maintaining operations log, ensuring normal service delivery, regulator intervention, manual routing, stock positioning, granting off-peak blockage, conflict prediction and resolution, issuing temporary timetable, testing back-up facilities, running route availability, running sectional time, establishing order of implementation and other operational planning decisions.

As a signaller, he is responsible for the administration of train drivers, by issuing them fleet plan for keeping track of train positions and locations. Neil updates the route settings on Driver Machine Interface (DMI) as a part of European Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS) signalling control operations. He has to make route decisions by sending train data to DMI for train movement and ensure safety. </activities>
  <attitudes>As a part of his routine, Neil is supervising train drivers. The train drivers precede their journey, based on directives known as movement authority from signallers. Neil plans and sometime reschedules the journey information based on ERTMS standard which becomes visible to train drivers on their on-board DMI. 

Neil also keeps record of GSM-R status of every train. In case, of any incident the investigation can be conducted using the traffic information kept as evidence by Neil.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Neil has to be vigilant while make train signalling control and operational decisions, as they may lead to hazardous events if managed poorly. Similarly, the verification of Temporary Speed Restrictions (TSR) uploaded during routine system update is also duty of signaller. He has to ensure efficient regulation of trains. In order to fulfil safe operations, he has to be able to identify possible faults that could possibly compromise the safety.

Upon IT failure, Neil reported it to concerned technicians and immediately reverted to manual routing. As management of ERTMS failures, he is authorised to inform the nature of faults identified during operation. He is also authorised to determine the failure impact on train operations and possible responses for these faults. After recovery of trains from system failures, it is Neil's job to resume their usage. </aptitudes>
  <motivations>Neil has to ensure that safety of people is not compromised at any cost. The interoperability of control and command of signalling technical specifications is primary responsibility of Neil. He has to advise train drivers regarding their movement, maximum speed and ERTMS mode required. In case of emergency, he also has to alert the train drivers. During train movement, Neil has to manage the closing of barriers and gates to road traffic. His maximum efforts should be to minimize any possible hazardous events. 

Neil has to make definite and sustained actions and anticipate errors even before their occurrence.</motivations>
